    title: "Python Minimum Version"
    description: "Enforce a minimum supported Python version for code, dependencies, and tooling."
    enforce: true
    tags: ["python", "language", "runtime", "governance"]

  content:

    applies_to: ["repo://*"]
    directives:
      - id: "minimum_python_3_12"
        level: "required"
        statement: "The codebase MUST target Python 3.12+ as the minimum supported runtime unless an explicit operator waiver exists."
        rationale: "AU-SYS governance standardizes on modern Python features, typing, and security support windows."
        verification: "Evidence includes repo configuration showing requires-python>=3.12 (or equivalent) and a runtime check (e.g. python --version)."

      - id: "deps_support_minimum"
        level: "required"
        statement: "Dependencies used in production paths MUST support the minimum Python version."
        rationale: "Prevents deploy/runtime failures due to incompatible dependency wheels or syntax."
        verification: "Dependency metadata / lockfile constraints / build output shows compatibility; incompatible dependencies are upgraded or replaced."

      - id: "tooling_enforces_minimum"
        level: "recommended"
        statement: "Build, lint, and test tooling SHOULD be configured to enforce the minimum Python version (CI, pyproject, tox/nox, etc.)."
        rationale: "Automated enforcement reduces drift and prevents accidental introduction of unsupported syntax."
        verification: "CI/tooling configuration references the minimum Python version and runs successfully."
