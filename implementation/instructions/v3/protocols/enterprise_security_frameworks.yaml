    description: "Codify the v2 security posture mandates (cybersecurity + AI security) as enforceable v3 directives."
    enforce: true
    tags: ["security", "compliance", "owasp", "nist", "iso27001"]

  content:

    applies_to: ["repo://*"]
    directives:
      - id: "framework_alignment_required"
        level: "required"
        statement: "Security controls MUST align with enterprise frameworks (NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, OWASP Top 10/ASVS) and applicable AI security guidance (e.g., NIST AI RMF, OWASP LLM Top 10) unless explicitly scoped out by the operator."
        rationale: "AU-SYS deployments target high-security environments and require defensible, auditable controls."
        verification: "Provide a brief control mapping (what applies and where implemented) and evidence of security validation (SAST/dep scanning/logging)."

      - id: "least_privilege"
        level: "required"
        statement: "Systems MUST enforce least privilege (credentials, tokens, roles, filesystem/network access) and avoid overly broad permissions by default."
        rationale: "Reduces blast radius and supports defense-in-depth."
        verification: "Configuration and code show restricted permissions; privileged modes are justified and documented."

      - id: "security_logging"
        level: "required"
        statement: "Security-relevant events MUST be logged in a reviewable form (authz decisions, access failures, critical config changes) without leaking secrets."
        rationale: "Security operations require observability; logging must not introduce credential exposure."
        verification: "Logs exist for security events; secrets are not present in log output; log fields are structured where supported."
