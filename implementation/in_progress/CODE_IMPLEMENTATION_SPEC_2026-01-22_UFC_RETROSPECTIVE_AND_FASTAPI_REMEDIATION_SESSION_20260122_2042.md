## 📊 SESSION SUMMARY

### Session Objective

This session is focused on the **structural remediation and granular decomposition** of the `au_sys_fastapi_services_platform` capability, strictly adhering to the UFC (Universal Fractal Codebase) architecture mandates.

**Strategic Goal**: Transform the monolithic legacy codebase into a suite of **idempotent, single-task services and modules**. We will not merely "move" code; we will **decompose** it into distinct, isolated packages that constitute the `au-sys` capabilities.

### core Philosophy: "Domain-Led Dissection & High-Accuracy Automation"
- **Domain Level Dissection First**: Identify and extract high-level **Capability Services** (Functional Domains) first. Granular decomposition (<300 LOC) is a secondary *integrity requirement*, not the primary architectural driver.
- **Hierarchical Preservation**: **CRITICAL** - Maintain relative source/legacy directory hierarchies.
- **High-Accuracy Automation (>98%)**: All automation scripts (Discovery, Audit, Decomposition, Migration) must achieve >98% accuracy. Scripts must self-validate, handle edge cases (relative imports, path resolution), and fail safely.
- **Zero Tolerance Remnant**: No manual hacking. If the script fails, **fix the script**.

### FastAPI Services Platform Context Loaded

The following FastAPI Services Platform documentation has been reviewed:

- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/README.md` - Main platform documentation
- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/engine/README.md` - Engine runtime layer
- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/docs/README.md` - Documentation index
- ✅ `src/services/fastapi_services_platform/docs/architecture/README.md` - Architecture documentation index

**Key Understanding**:

- FastAPI Services Platform is a **FOUNDATIONAL DROP-IN SERVICE CAPABILITY**
- Uses its OWN dedicated databases (separate from application databases)
- Self-configuring via config files (`router_factory_settings.yaml`, `router_factory_features.yaml`, `feature_flags.json`)
- App Factory ONLY CALLS Router Factory, does NOT configure it
- Router registration order: API → UI → Platform API → Platform UI (Hub Router ABSOLUTE LAST)

### Phase 6: Operational Validation & Containerization Findings (2026-01-23)

**Critical Success: Full Container Validation Pipeline Established**

We have successfully established a robust, container-aware validation pipeline that ensures "Identity of Construction" between the development environment and the production container artifact.

**1. STRICT PACKAGING PROTOCOL ENFORCED**
- **Issue**: Local `pyproject.toml` used `[tool.uv.sources]` to link dependencies via relative paths (e.g., `../au_sys_ufc_app`). These paths are valid in the Monorepo but invalid inside a standalone Docker build context.
- **Solution**: The `ufc_build_pipeline.py` script now performs **Sanitization on Build**:
    1.  Copies the target package to a build context.
    2.  Reads `pyproject.toml`.
    3.  **STRIPS** the `[tool.uv.sources]` section entirely.
    4.  Relies on Injecting Wheel Artifacts directly into the build command.
    5.  Results in a clean, production-ready `pyproject.toml` inside the container.

**2. CONTAINER-AWARE VALIDATION SUITE**
- **Architecture**: The validation logic (`validate_*.py`) must run *both* on the host (Dev) and inside the container (CI/CD).
- **Innovation**: Implemented `ValidationPathResolver` (`path_resolver.py`):
    - Detects if running in a Monorepo (Git present, parent structure matches).
    - Detects if running in a Container (Flat site-packages structure).
    - Dynamically resolves paths to `logs`, `artifacts`, and `src` based on environment.
    - **Outcome**: Single test suite works everywhere without modification.

**3. FULL BUILD TO DOCKER DESKTOP SUCCESS**
- **Target**: `au_sys_digital_angels_identity`
- **Process**:
    1.  `gen_api_inventory.py` -> Auto-discovered 21 endpoints.
    2.  `validate_01_smoke.py` -> Verified Imports & Adapters.
    3.  `validate_04_api_compliance.py` -> Verified all 21 endpoints against Inventory.
    4.  `docker build` -> Successful multi-stage build (Distroless base).
    5.  `docker run` -> **PASSED** (4/4 tests passed inside container).

**4. TEMPLATE PROMOTION**
- The successful patterns (`runner.py`, `framework.py`, `path_resolver.py`, `gen_api_inventory.py`) have been **PROMOTED** to the `au_sys_ufc_app_template` and `ufc_blueprint_template`.
- Future capabilities will inherit this "Container-Ready" status by default.

**Status**: ✅ Phase 6 Validation COMPLETE. Capability is Production-Ready.

### Session Handover (Jan 23, 2026) - Validation Standardization & Remediation

#### 1. Progress: Validation Standardization ✅
We successfully standardized the "Container-Aware" Validation Suite across the platform:
*   **Artifacts Promoted**: `runner.py`, `framework.py`, `path_resolver.py`, `gen_api_inventory.py`.
*   **Templates Updated**:
    *   `au_sys_ufc_app_template` (Core source of truth).
    *   `ufc_blueprint_template` (Scaffolding source).
    *   `ufc_capability_factory/.../ufc_template` (Internal tooling).
*   **Documentation**: `MASTER_RUNBOOK.md` and `PROCESS_GUIDE.md` updated with "Strict Packaging Protocol" details.

#### 2. Challenge: Unified Storage Remediation (Brownfield) ⚠️
We analyzed `au_sys_unified_storage` for retrofit of the new validation suite.
*   **Current Tooling**: `scaffold_target.py`.
*   **Failure Mode**: The tool performs a "dumb sync" (overwrite).
*   **Critical Risk**: Running it on `au_sys_unified_storage` would:
    *   Overwrite `pyproject.toml` (Losing `pymongo`, `motor`, `tinydb` dependencies).
    *   Overwrite `manifest/container.py` (Potentially losing custom injections).
*   **Conclusion**: The current automation primitives are unsafe for remediation of active services.

#### 3. Action Items (Next Session)
1.  **Upgrade Tooling (High Priority)**:
    *   Modify `scaffold_target.py` (or create `remediate_target.py`).
    *   **Feature**: `pyproject.toml` Smart Merge (Preserve existing `[dependencies]`).
    *   **Feature**: Manifest Preservation (Do not overwrite if file exists).
2.  **Execute Remediation**:
    *   Run upgraded tool on `au_sys_unified_storage`.
    *   Verify `validation/` directory is created.
    *   Verify dependencies are preserved.
    *   Run `python -m au_sys_unified_storage.validation.runner`.

### Next Steps

1. **Await Explicit Implementation Task**
   - User must provide explicit implementation task or requirement details
   - Scope information needed if not provided
   - Files/modules information needed if not provided

2. **Codebase Examination and Gap Analysis** (When Task Identified)
   - Examine production codebase for missing elements, TODOs, mocks, stubs, unfinished code

   - Adapt each one step by step, validate then continue to the next

7. **Implementation** (When Task Identified)
   - Focus on implementing, refactoring and validating groups of items from identified list
   - Continue to implement, fix, remediate and refactor the plan until complete

   - Validate the plan has successfully completed
   - Record planning in CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC structured checklists (no code examples)
   - Maintain and update progress through the plan in CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC
   - Update structured checklists as work progresses

8. **Iterate Through Plans** (When Task Identified)
   - Continue to iterate through plans in CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC until all plans are completed
   - All plans must pass code quality checks and have been validated
   - Review structured checklists to identify next plan to execute
   - Repeat implementation sequence for each plan until all complete

## 📋 STRUCTURED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN CHECKLISTS

### Purpose

Structured checklists are used to organize and track implementation work by groups of related items. These checklists are recorded in CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC and are used to locate the current or next plan to execute.

### Checklist Structure

Each implementation plan checklist should include:

- **Group Name**: Descriptive name for the group of items
- **Group Description**: Brief description of what this group addresses
- **Items List**: List of items in this group (DO NOT include code examples)
- **Status**: Current status (Pending / In Progress / Complete)
- **Priority**: Priority level (P0-CRITICAL / P1-HIGH / P2-MEDIUM / P3-LOW)
- **Dependencies**: Any dependencies on other groups or items
- **Validation Criteria**: What constitutes completion for this group
- **Checklist Items**: Structured checklist of tasks/steps for this group

### Checklist Usage

1. **Review Checklists**: Before starting work, review CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC structured checklists to locate the current or next plan to execute
2. **Select Group**: Identify which group of items to work on based on priority, dependencies, and current status
3. **Execute Group**: Focus on implementing, refactoring and validating the selected group of items
4. **Update Checklist**: Update the checklist as work progresses, marking items complete
5. **Validate Group**: Ensure all items in the group are complete and validated before moving to next group

### Critical Reminders (MANDATORY VERIFICATION BEFORE COMPLETION)

**100% COMPLETE = PRODUCTION CODE IMPLEMENTATION**

Before marking any work complete, you MUST verify:

1. **COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **IF THERE IS A FEATURE, MODULE OR FUNCTION NOT 100% COMPLETE... CAN THAT BE CONSIDERED 100% PRODUCTION CODE IMPLEMENTATION?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: NO - Incomplete features/modules/functions CANNOT be considered 100% production code implementation
   - **REQUIREMENT**: ALL features, modules, and functions MUST be 100% complete before completion

2. **REMAINING ACTIVITIES VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **ARE THERE ANY REMAINING ACTIVITIES OR TASKS THAT REQUIRE ATTENTION?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: NO - There must be ZERO remaining activities or tasks
   - **REQUIREMENT**: ALL activities and tasks MUST be completed before marking work complete

3. **ENTERPRISE QUALITY VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **HAS THE PRODUCTION CODE BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF ENTERPRISE-CLASS PRODUCTION QUALITY WITH NO FUTURE OR PLANNED TASKS, ITEMS, OR ACTIVITIES?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: YES - Production code MUST meet enterprise-class production quality standards with ZERO future or planned tasks
   - **REQUIREMENT**: Code MUST be enterprise-class production quality with NO pending items

4. **DILIGENCE VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ **IF THERE ARE PENDING ITEMS, ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES CONSIDERED FULFILLED?**
   - **ANSWER MUST BE**: NO - Pending items reflect unfulfilled responsibilities and lack of diligence
   - **REQUIREMENT**: Prompt action is REQUIRED to address ALL pending matters without delay
   - **ENFORCEMENT**: Pending items = INCOMPLETE WORK = RESPONSIBILITIES UNFULFILLED

**COMPLETION CRITERIA**: Work can ONLY be marked complete when ALL four verification questions are answered correctly and ALL requirements are met.

  - Pinpoint partially completed items that can be reactivated/restored from cloned repos
  - Record all planning in CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC (DO NOT include code examples)

- **MCP Tools Usage** (MANDATORY)
  - MUST use MCP Grep to search codebase and GitHub repos
  - MUST use MCP Fetch to retrieve repositories, code examples, or semantically similar codebase
  - MUST use GIT TO CLONE all useful discovered GitHub repos (even if small benefit)
  - Cloned repos are for future reference/examples - do NOT remove them
  - Document all cloned repos and their purposes in CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC

- **Group-Based Implementation** (MANDATORY)
  - Review CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC structured checklists to locate current/next plan to execute
  - Focus on implementing, refactoring and validating groups of items from identified list
  - Execute groups with precision and adherence to best practices
  - Record structured checklists in CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC (DO NOT include code examples)
  - Update structured checklists as work progresses
  - Validate groups before moving to next group
  - Continue to iterate through plans until all plans are completed, pass code quality checks and validated

- **Copy-and-Adapt Methodology** (MANDATORY - FORBIDDEN: Re-writing)
  - MUST COPY and adapt acquired directory structures, files, modules, functions, code blocks and content to prod codebase
  - FORBIDDEN: DO NOT re-write any part of the content - THIS IS ERROR PRONE
  - Adapt each one step by step, validate then continue to the next
  - Continue to implement, fix, remediate and refactor the plan until complete
  - Maintain and update progress through the plan in CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC

- Search before writing code (MANDATORY)
- Scope lock before implementation (MANDATORY)
- Scaffold before implementing (MANDATORY)
- Pre-flight violation scan before starting work (MANDATORY)
- File modification checkpoint before modifying files (MANDATORY)
- Post-modification validation after modifying files (MANDATORY)
- Zero-tolerance verification before completion (MANDATORY)

### FastAPI-Specific Notes

- ALL endpoints MUST be `async def` (NO exceptions)
- NO blocking calls in async context
- Connection pooling MANDATORY for HTTP clients
- Database pooling + pre-ping MANDATORY
- Keep-alive MUST be enabled
- Structured error handling MANDATORY
- Retry mechanisms MANDATORY
- Circuit breakers MANDATORY for critical integrations
- Health monitoring MANDATORY for connection pools

### Critical Reminders (MANDATORY BEFORE COMPLETION)

**BEFORE MARKING ANY WORK COMPLETE, YOU MUST VERIFY:**

1. **100% COMPLETE VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ Is every feature, module, and function 100% complete?
   - ❓ Can incomplete features/modules/functions be considered 100% production code implementation?
   - **REQUIREMENT**: NO - Incomplete code CANNOT be considered production code
   - **ACTION**: Complete ALL features, modules, and functions to 100% before completion

2. **ZERO PENDING ITEMS VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ Are there any remaining activities or tasks that require attention?
   - **REQUIREMENT**: NO - There must be ZERO remaining activities or tasks
   - **ACTION**: Complete ALL activities and tasks before marking work complete

3. **ENTERPRISE QUALITY VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ Has production code been fully implemented to meet enterprise-class production quality standards?
   - ❓ Are there any future or planned tasks, items, or activities?
   - **REQUIREMENT**: YES to quality, NO to pending items
   - **ACTION**: Ensure enterprise-class production quality with ZERO pending items

4. **DILIGENCE VERIFICATION**
   - ❓ If there are pending items, are responsibilities considered fulfilled?
   - **REQUIREMENT**: NO - Pending items = unfulfilled responsibilities = lack of diligence
   - **ACTION**: Prompt action REQUIRED to address ALL pending matters without delay

**COMPLETION BLOCKER**: Work CANNOT be marked complete if ANY of these verifications fail.

**RESPONSIBILITY**: Unfulfilled verifications reflect lack of diligence and require immediate attention.
